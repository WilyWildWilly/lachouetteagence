# lachouetteagence
an exercise for the 4th module of the openclassrooms web developer path

## what this is meant for and how to use it
This is an optimized version of a phony website ridden with bad practices.
The use it's meant to have is to be checked out with such tools as Google Lighthouse, GTMetrix and the dev console of your browser.

To do this, connect to https://wilywildwilly.github.io/old_lachouetteagence/index.html (the old version) and do your measurements.
Then, connect to the optimized version at https://wilywildwilly.github.io/lachouetteagence/index.html, do the same measurements and check the difference.

This is not meant for cloning. Even if you've enrolled in the same path of the same school, please use the repo Openclassroom gave you. Taking inspiration from this for your own work might be risky as the version they gave you might include different challenges.
